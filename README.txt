We are currently working on the linear regression model. 

To play around with the linear regression model, you need to use the linreg.py file. This will reference the data/2017_stats.csv file and run linear regressions on it. 

The file data/add_some_columns.py has been used to add a number of the factors that are being regressed on; please continue to use this file when adding columns. This will make future error checking more manageable by keeping track of how all columns were made in one place.
