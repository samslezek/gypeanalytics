Linear Regression Model:
1. Create a working linear model for example (done in linreg_test.py)
2. Get the following into our dataset
	-Season average DKP (up to the date of the game log)
	-Last 5 games average DKP (before date of game log)
	-Spread of the game
	-Whether or not the game is a back to back
	-Opponentâ€™s average points per game allowed (up to the date of the game log)
3. Adjust the linear regression to run off the variables above

Beginning to look at a separate linear regression for used %: 
1. Pull all player used % statistics and incorporate into existing CSV

Organization: 
1. Separate the tasks of pulling (and later creating) projections and optimizing lineups into separate files.
